    <h3 class="siteFont center-align">About Me</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="center-align">Spencer Rose is an award-winning comedian from Chicago, Illinois. He has performed around the city and will began national shows in the fall. Of course, comedy pays dirt, so he does coding to make the big bucks.</p>
    <p class="center-align">You can see him working hard on many podcasts around the city including GeekOut with Spencer & Kevin, Death at a Bake Sale, and Absolutely Not. As both a producer and on-air talent, Spencer is really good at talking (especially about himself and especially in third person).</p>
    <p class="center-align">When it comes to coding, front end is Spencer's bread and butter. He has loved learning React and built the Death at a Bake Sale website by himself using the tool. CSS Tricks? He's got 'em. Creative ideas? Got those, too. Hardworking coder who would love to get his start in the industry? You're looking at him. </p>
